                       Please provide a brief description of your proposed BDD scenario, including:
                       1. The feature it relates to
                       2. The specific behavior being tested
                       3. Why you believe this scenario is important
                       4. How it differs from or complements existing scenarios
                       
                       This information will help in accurately assessing the scenario's value.

                       ## Common Pitfalls
                       - Quantity over quality.
                       - Ignoring business context.
                       - Overvaluing edge cases.
                       - Undervaluing negative scenarios.
                       - Neglecting maintainability.
                       
                       ## Example Assessments
                       - **Low-Value**:
                         ```
                         Scenario: User views homepage
                           Given user is on the website
                           When they navigate to the homepage
                           Then they see the homepage
                         ```
                         - **Reason**: Too vague, implicit coverage.
                         - **Suggestion**: Focus on specific homepage elements.
                         
                       - **High-Value**:
                         ```
                         Scenario: User successfully completes a purchase with a promotional code
                         Given the user has items in their shopping cart
                         And a valid promotional code "SUMMER20" exists
                         When the user applies the "SUMMER20" code at checkout
                         And completes the purchase
                         Then the user should receive a 20% discount on the total price
                         And the order confirmation should reflect the discounted price
                         And the inventory should be updated accordingly
                         ```
                         - **Reason**: Tests critical business function, includes common variation, verifies outcomes.
                         - **Suggestion**: Add related scenarios for comprehensive coverage.
